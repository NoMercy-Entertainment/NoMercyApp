# NoMercy.App Performance Optimization Progress

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1.1: Configure Manual Chunks (vite.config.ts)
- Status: DONE (prior to this session)
- Changed manualChunks from object syntax to function syntax for rolldown-vite compatibility

### Phase 1.2: Fix Layout Imports (src/router/routes.ts)
- Status: DONE
- Date: 2026-02-05
- Changed layout imports from immediate execution to lazy-loaded functions:
  - `const MobileBaseLayout = import(...)` → `const MobileBaseLayout = () => import(...)`
  - `const DesktopBaseLayout = import(...)` → `const DesktopBaseLayout = () => import(...)`
- This prevents both layouts from loading at module initialization; only the needed layout loads when used

## Next Tasks (from PRD)
- Phase 1.3: Remove Swiper Duplication (src/setupApp.ts)
- Phase 1.4: Add Preconnect Hints (index.html)
