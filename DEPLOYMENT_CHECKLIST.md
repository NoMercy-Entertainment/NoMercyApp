## Deployment Commands

```bash
# Build and analyze
npm run build
npm run analyze

# Performance check
node scripts/build-optimization.cjs

# Deploy
# (Add your deployment commands here)
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Production site loads correctly
- [ ] Service worker active in DevTools
- [ ] Performance metrics within targets
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] All features working correctly

## Rollback Plan

If performance regression detected:
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify service worker status
3. Compare bundle sizes with previous deployment
4. Rollback to previous version if necessary
